<p>
<b>  A list of things that Christians can’t do are as follows </b>
</p>
<p>
    •	Cannot commit adultery </p>
    This means that you can not have sexual intimacy before marriage.
    <p>    •	Visiting Church every week.
    Most Christians visit Church every week </p>
    <p>  •	Donate 10% or more of your income to charity and the building up of the kingdom of God
    This might be bad as some people don’t want to spend their money straight after they got their pay check. </p>
    <p>  •	No cigarettes, coffee, tea or tobacco.  We believe life is a gift from God and we do our best to keep our bodies healthy and clean.
    Although I don’t believe this is actually true, I couldn’t know. Banning coffee as a Christian seems pretty over the top but as I said I don’t know at all. </p>
   <p> •	Teenagers do not date until 16 years-old.   </p>
    <p>  •	No gambling. </p>
        <p> •	Abortion is not allowed if you are a Christian. “Members of the church strongly oppose abortion and do not participate in abortion in any way.” – PurposeInChrist. The 10 commandments say, “Thou shalt not kill.”  Church leaders have opened the possibility for abortion in extreme instances of danger to the mother’s life.
             What do I think about this?  </p>
            
    I think this is an alright thing other than the drinking coffee and tea is not allowed for a Christian to do due to the fact they want to keep their bodies healthy. Coffee and especially tea doesn’t have major health risks if you regulate the amount you drink. 
    I also believe that having to donate 10% or more of your income to a charity doesn’t seem right as a rule to be forced upon you. Although it does seem right, people who don’t really have a good job that makes them a lot of money doesn’t seem right to force it upon them.
