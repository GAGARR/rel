<p>Being a Christian is a Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teaching of Jesus of Nazareth. It is the world's largest religion, with about 2.4 billion followers. Some of the "basic beliefs of Christianity" are:</p>
 <p><b>   Love God. </b></p>
    <p><b>   Love your neighbor as yourself. </b></p>
        <p><b>    Forgive others who have wronged you. </b></p>
            <p><b>    Love your enemies. </b></p>
                <p><b>    Ask God for forgiveness of your sins. </b></p>
                    <p> <b>    Jesus is the Messiah and was given the authority to forgive others. </b></p>
                        <p><b>    Repentance of sins is essential.  </b></p>
</p>
<P>==================================================================================================================================================</P>
<p> Why do I think that being a Christian is good because of these rules? </p>
 <P> I Believe these rules help keep people great people of society.
 Having people who are affectionate to each other can help people a lot at sometimes and make people feel like they have someone to help them if they need help. 
 The rule where Christians Hate/Dislike anything that is evil, this is a great thing because obviously evil is a bad thing for this world and hating it can, possibly,
 limit it or try cleansing the evil off someone.
